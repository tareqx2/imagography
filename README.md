IMAGOGRAPHY
-----------

This is a code challenge from Hackerearth.com that I decided to participate in. 
<pre>
[Problem Statement]

Develop a WebApp which would help user interactively upload and manage images online.

[Minimum Requirement]

— Ability to upload image and display them.

— Page with an interactive design displaying images.

— Any client side Javascript library you are good at, HTML5 features, CSS3.

— Upload source file as ZIP.

[Plus Point]

— Feature to search images.

— Awesomeness: Like, Share, Download restaurant.

— You may add portfolio page comprising awesome work you have done on PHP.

— Use your imagination to come up with additional features to simplify image sharing!

[Guide]

— use your favourite backend language to code around

— jQuery or any of your favorite client side scripting language.

— For bootstrap/icons/fonts/textures:

http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

http://glyphsearch.com/

http://subtlepatterns.com/thumbnail-view/

https://www.google.com/fonts

— Though the application can be build without storing any data in a database but if you can build an option of storing the data in a backend or HTML5 LocalStorage, you will get extra points for that.

— You can use any simple database like LocalStorage, SQLite or MySQL, and while submitting your solution ZIP, include the SQL file along with instructions to set up the database.
